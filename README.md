# Climate Change Analysis: India

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for analyzing and predicting climate change impacts in India, with a focus on Air Quality Index (AQI) and Extreme Weather Events. The project is designed for data science analysis and seamless Power BI visualization.

---

## 🌏 Project Motivation & Objective

Climate change is leading to more frequent extreme weather events and deteriorating air quality, especially in developing countries like India.  
**Objectives:**
- Predict AQI and extreme weather events for Indian cities using machine learning.
- Provide actionable insights and visualizations for policymakers, researchers, and the public.

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. **Train Models**
- `src/train_aqi_model.py`: Trains a RandomForestRegressor to predict AQI using climate and city features.
- `src/train_extreme_event_model.py`: Trains a classifier to predict extreme weather events.

### 2. **Test Models**
- `src/predict_on_test.py`: Evaluates both models on test data, prints metrics (MAE, accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report), and compares actual vs predicted values.

### 3. **Export for Power BI**
- `src/export_for_powerbi.py`: Generates `predictions_for_powerbi.csv` with actual and predicted AQI and events for visualization.

## 📈 Summary Statistics & Insights

- **AQI Model:**  
  - Mean Absolute Error (Train): ~124.5  
  - Mean Absolute Error (Test): ~77.1  
  - **Feature Importances:** Economic Impact, Population Exposure, Humidity, Precipitation, Wind Speed

- **Extreme Event Model:**  
  - Accuracy (Train): ~27%  
  - Accuracy (Test): ~73%  
  - **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report:** Model predicts common events well, struggles with rare events due to class imbalance.

---

## 📉 Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies

- **Patterns:**  
  - AQI is influenced most by economic impact, population exposure, and weather features.
  - Most test samples are "None" or "Flood" for events.

- **Trends:**  
  - Model generalizes well for AQI and frequent events.
  - Class imbalance affects rare event prediction.

- **Anomalies:**  
  - Some rare events (Drought, Hurricane) are underrepresented and harder to predict.

## 📊 Initial Visual Representation

- **Power BI Ready:**  
  - Exported `predictions_for_powerbi.csv` is structured for easy import into Power BI.
  - Columns: Date, City, Actual AQI, Actual Event, Predicted AQI, Predicted Event

- **Sample Table:**

| Date      | City | Air Quality Index (AQI) | Actual_Event | Predicted_AQI | Predicted_Event |
|-----------|------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1/1/2024  | 1    | 276                     | None         | 269.97        | None            |
| 1/3/2024  | 1    | 472                     | None         | 350.90        | Flood           |
| 1/14/2024 | 1    | 453                     | Flood        | 361.90        | Flood           |
| 1/15/2024 | 1    | 82                      | Flood        | 161.58        | Heatwave        |

## ⚠️ Notes & Best Practices

- **File Paths:**  
  Always use forward slashes (`/`) in file paths for cross-platform compatibility.

- **Missing Values:**  
  All missing values in "Extreme Weather Events" are handled as `"None"` in both training and prediction.

- **Encoders:**  
  All encoders are saved as `.pkl` files for reuse and consistency between training and prediction.

- **Class Imbalance:**  
  The dataset may be imbalanced for rare events. Consider using resampling or class weights for better event prediction.
